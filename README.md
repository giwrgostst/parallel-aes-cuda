# Parallel AES Cryptography with CUDA

This project implements the full **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)** algorithm for both encryption and decryption using **CUDA C**. It demonstrates how symmetric block ciphers like AES can be parallelized and executed on the GPU for significant speedups.

The code was tested and executed successfully using **Visual Studio Code** and an **NVIDIA GTX 1650** GPU.
